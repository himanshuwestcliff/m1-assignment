        <p>At the Huntington Beach Dog Adoption Committee, we think all dogs should have access to love, care, and a secure home.  Dogs of all kinds, ages, and histories are the focus of our rescue efforts, and we make sure they get the care, love, and training they require before finding new homes.  We work to decrease the number of homeless pets and encourage responsible pet ownership with the help of our amazing volunteers and kind donors.  Adopt, foster, donate, or volunteer today to support our work and help us provide these amazing dogs with the fulfilling lives they deserve!</p>
